DESCRIPTION:

Project Title: API Integration and Data Visualization

Project Description:

This project focuses on integrating a public API to extract real-time data and present it through insightful visualizations. Using Python, we fetch weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and analyze it to derive temperature trends over time. The data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful Python libraries for data representation.

The project demonstrates proficiency in:

API integration using the requests library,
Data processing and transformation,
Creating interactive and aesthetic data visualizations.
Objectives:

To understand how to interact with RESTful APIs.
To extract and process JSON data.
To visualize real-time data using line charts and plots.
Tools & Technologies:*

Python
Requests(API interaction)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
OpenWeatherMap API (Data source)
Deliverables:

A Python script that:

Fetches data from the API,
Parses and processes the data,
Generates a line chart of temperature over time.
A visualization dashboard (optionally using Streamlit or Dash for interactivity).
Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience working with public APIs.
Improved data analysis and visualization skills.
Understood how to build simple dashboards and real-time data apps.
